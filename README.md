# RJQ_PasswordGenerator

Usage Guide: Click "Generate Password" then follow the prompts on screen.

Everyone has the issue of their passwords being figured out, especially when tied to birthdays, anniversaries, names of friends, pets, etc. This password generator seeks to solve that issue by giving the user a completely randomized password string ranging from 8-128 characters.
Enjoyed making this, was able to do some research and learn about the concat function to join multiple strings, which if I had more time I would have liked to simplify my if statements and do one big concat at the end, rather than 4 seperate ones. I'd like to come back to this at some point and change the passLength section to also have a randomizing function, in case the user wants a password with a random length too. What I really liked about making this is I can see myself using it to generate my own passwords, and real world applicability is just what I'm looking for!
